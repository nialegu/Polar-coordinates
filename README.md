Coordinates in a **Polar coordinate system** have two values - radius *r* and angle *a*. This program present us how to add two or more polar coordinates using an overloaded aritnmetic operation with conversion to **Cartesian coordinate system** and back.

I'll be glad to receive constructive comments about this program, because I could ahve made a mistakes that I didn't find.
